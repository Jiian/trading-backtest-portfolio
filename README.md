# trading-backtest-portfolio

This repository stores the codes to backtest several momentum-based trading strategies.

## Trading Setup
From the point of view of an asset-management entity, the goal is to maximise the returns through holding positive positions of stocks while adhering to the agreed-upon trading strategy and universe of assets.

### Scope and Assumptions
1. The stocks under consideration are what are famously-known as the "Magnificent 7" companies today: AAPL, MSFT, META, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN and GOOG.
2. Only long positions are allowed.
3. Rebalancing is allowed only when a trading signal is triggered.
4. Backtest for the years 1981 to 2023 inclusive.
5. Daily level price data.
6. Evaluate signal post-market, react on market-open.

### Financial Parameters
All parameters are contained within the `./config.py` file.

1. RSI is considered a leading indicator. Using RSI alone to indicate mean-reversion timings produced a return far lower than the S&P500 index.
2. Adding MACD as a lagging indicator for momentum, the results significantly outperformed the first model. The model has also outperformed the S&P500 index in total returns over the long run.
3. While it is tempting to minimise the drawdown and volatility of the trading strategy in step 2, both approaches that were experimented with resulted in significantly worse metrics.

    (a) Both HRP and Volatility-adjusted portfolio optimisation approaches aim to reduce volatility in the portfolio by setting a lower weight to the higher volatility instruments.

    (b) Given that the magnificent 7 companies are high-performing in hindsight, they are in a long-term uptrend. In such an uptrend, the returns are usually driven by the more volatile stocks. The de-prooritisation of these stocks resulted in the strategies missing out on the upside.

    (c) Volatility-adjusted portfolio optimisation is unsuitable to be used together with our mean-reverting RSI strategy. By definition, an instrument that is oversold has experienced a recent downtrend. Adjusting the portfolio by looking at its recent volatility-adjusted returns are not helpful, given that the returns are likely poor.
